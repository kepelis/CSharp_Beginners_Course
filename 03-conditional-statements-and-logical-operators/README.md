# 3. Conditional statements and logical operators

C# has a lot of different operators: comparison, equality, logical, etc. Don't stop reading if you don't know what an operator is because it is pretty self-explanatory. The only thing you have to remember is that to understand operators you have to understand `bool` types (see chapter 2). Following operators are arguably the most common ones:
* `==` (EQUAL) - returns  `true` if both sides are equal i.e. 1 == 2 returns `false`, 2 == 2 returns `true`...
* `!=` (NOT EQUAL) - returns  `true` if both sides are not equal i.e. 1 != 2 returns `true`, 2 != 2 returns `false`...
* `>` (GREATER) and `<` (LOWER) - returns  `true` if one of the sides is greater (or lower) than the other i.e. 1 > 2 returns `false`, 3 > 2 returns `true`...
* `>=` (GREATER OR EQUAL) and `<=` (LOWER OR EQUAL) - returns  `true` if one of the sides is greater or equal (or lower or equal) than the other i.e. 1 >= 2 returns `false`, 2 >= 2 returns `true`...
* `&&` (AND) - returns  `true` if both of the sides are equal to `true` i.e. `true` && `false` returns `false`, `false` && `false` returns `false`, `true` && `true` returns `true`...
* `||` (OR) - returns  `true` if at least one of the sides is equal to `true` i.e. `true` || `false` returns `true`, `false` || `false` returns `false`, `true` || `true` returns `true`...

Keep in mind that you can use those operators with variables:
```csharp
var givenName = Console.ReadLine();
var myName = "John";
var isGivenMyName = givenName == myName;
```
